# The Catalog eixtension

This extension allows management of a catalog of products to [Eix](http://eix.nohex.com)-based applications.

## Usage

In order to use the extension in your application, just include its `.phar` when required.

The preferred place to include it is in the boostrap code, which may as well be in `index.php`.

```
require_once 'eixtension-catalog-0.1.0.phar';
```
